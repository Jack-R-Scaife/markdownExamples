# Weekly Log (Week 1) 21/09/2023 - 28/09/2023

## Github Markdown
Prepare Github markdown examples.
<details>
It was suggested that github markdown could be used as a method of creating and storing our documentation for the group project as the previous year had excellent results doing this. Some team members are unfamiliar with markdown so I offered to create a simple example of how we could achieve this.

## Research
Research project ideas, cheap sensors and applications for them and, ideas of personal interest.
<details>
There is some interest in the group for using some form of input device/s (sensors, touchscreen/gesture, etc) but more research is needed so all team members were asked to do some research before the next meeting on project ideas that they would be interested in doing.
